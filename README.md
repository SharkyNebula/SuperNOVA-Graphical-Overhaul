 "A mod that replaces EV Nova's ship graphics with SharkyNebula's excellent Supernova Shipyard graphics." -DrFiveMinusMinus
 
 "This adds boosted ship sizes, as well as unique shields, engine glows, running lights, visually appropriate weapon exit points, and weapon glows for every ship." -SharkyNebula

Since heavily modified by SharkyNebula to better suit EV Nova's original look. It's also available on [Github](https://github.com/NebulaTank/SuperNOVA-Graphical-Overhaul), where the latest version is always found.

## What this mod does:

Replaces the vanilla ship spritesheets, and the target, hail and info pictures with their [Supernova Shipyard](https://github.com/NebulaTank/Supernova-Shipyard) equivalents. As of version 1.4.0 it also makes the [following graphical changes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SVXtlQ6f4yT4DTWk4VLKQYm0NiD95mhGb_7xhvRjZc/edit?usp=sharing) to select weapon resources based on Nova 1.1 (last mac version's) data.

As of version 1.7.1 SN-GO now remakes all the planets and reassigns several space object's types as well as adjusting planetary spacing so that the new sprites don't overlap. [For a list of all space object changes visit THIS wiki page, please.](https://github.com/NebulaTank/Supernova-Shipyard-Wiki/wiki/3-Planetary-Reassignment)

## What this mod does not do:

1. Add any of the custom ships not found in the vanilla scenarios from Supernova

This mod should be compatible with everything that doesn't change shan's, so it should work with ShipVariants, weapon fixes etc. 

I recommend the [WinNova ResPatcher](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wFTaLFMIwIb3a0LK_91gg3H2PoBYgiDe/view?usp=sharing) to be used with this mod so that the larger ships have more screen real estate to occupy. If you patch your game to be widescreen, be sure to use the (included with the ResPatcher) Nova Roid fix so that asteroids don't disappear. SN-GO itself does not adjust the asteroids to ameliorate these issues.

If you desire to play in widescreen+fullscreen on Windows 7/10/11, you may experience some screen tearing in fullscreen mode. A cnc-ddraw.dll file is available from the EV Nova discord's democratic-nova-resources forum channel which greatly smoothes these issues out when placed in the EV Nova folder. I also recommend this.
